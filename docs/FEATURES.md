# Features Documentation

## Navigation System

### Smart Dropdown Menus
The navigation system uses a hybrid approach combining the accessibility of traditional dropdowns with modern click-based interaction.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Click-based activation instead of hover-only
- JavaScript state management for open/closed states
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Mobile-responsive collapse for smaller screens

**User Benefits:**
- Dropdown stays open when clicking menu items
- Works consistently across all devices
- Accessible with keyboard navigation
- Touch-friendly for mobile users

### Mobile Navigation
**Collapsible burger menu** activates on screens smaller than 768px:
- Smooth slide animation
- Hierarchical menu structure
- Touch-optimized spacing
- Active page highlighting

## Content Enhancement

### Mobile-First Collapsible Content
**Problem Solved:** Text-heavy sections overwhelming mobile users

**Implementation:**
- CSS-based height restrictions (120px initial)
- JavaScript toggle functionality
- Smooth animations with CSS transitions
- Progressive disclosure pattern

**User Experience:**
- Content preview with gradient fade
- "Read More" / "Read Less" toggle buttons
- Automatic scroll to expanded content
- Desktop users see full content always

### Character Decorations
**Design Philosophy:** Subtle visual enhancement without distraction

**Character Placement Strategy:**
- Inline with headings using flexbox
- Proportional sizing (w-10 to w-14)
- Hidden on mobile to maintain clean layout
- Different characters for visual variety

**Characters Used:**
- Home: Characters 1 & 2
- About: Character 2
- Competitions: Character 3  
- Contact: Character 4

### Responsive Design Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Screen Size | Navigation | Content Layout |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Mobile | < 768px | Burger menu | Single column, collapsible |
| Tablet | 768px - 1023px | Horizontal nav | Two columns |
| Desktop | 1024px+ | Full navigation | Three columns with sidebar |

## Animation System

### CSS Animation Classes
**Performance-Optimized Animations:**
- Hardware acceleration with `transform` properties
- Reduced motion compliance
- Staggered entrance animations
- Hover micro-interactions

**Animation Categories:**
